# Inquisitor

Easily build composable queries for Ecto.

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/DockYard/inquisitor.svg?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/DockYard/inquisitor)

## Usage

Adding Inquisitor to a project is simple:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.PostController do
  use Inquisitor

  def index(conn, params) do
    posts =
      App.Post
      |> build_query(conn, params)
      |> Repo.all()

    json(conn, posts)
  end
end
```

After `use Inquisitor` `build_query/3` is added to
the `MyApp.PostController`. It takes a queryable variable, the
`conn`, and the `params` as arguments.

This sets up a key/value queryable API for the `Post` model. Any
combination of fields on the model can be queried against. For example,
requesting `[GET] /posts?foo=bar&baz=qux` could create the query:

```sql
SELECT p0."foo", p0."baz" FROM posts as p0 WHERE (p0."foo" = $1) AND (p0."baz" = $1);
```

`$1` and `$2` will get the values of `"bar"` and `"qux"`,

### Security

By default Inquisitor is an opt-in library. It will not provide any
querying access to any key/value pair. The params list will be iterated
over and a no-op function is called on each element. You must add custom
query handlers that have a higher matching order on a case by case
basis.

If you'd like to add a catch-all for any key/value pair you can override
the default:

```elixir
def build_query(query, attr, value, _conn) do
  query
  |> Ecto.where([r], field(r, ^String.to_existing_atom(attr)) == ^value)
end
```

However, this is not recommended. Instead you should create a
`@whitelist` modulue attribute that contains all of they keys you
allowing access to:

```elixir
@whitelist ["title", "bio"]

def build_query(query, attr, value, _conn) when attr in @whitelist do
  query
  |> Ecto.where([r], field(r, ^String.to_existing_atom(attr)) == ^value)
end
```

This will handle matching keys in the whitelist and all unmatched keys
will fallback to the pass-through without affecting the query.

### Adding custom query handlers

Use `build_query/4` to add key/value pair handlers:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.PostsController do
  use Inquisitor

  def index(conn, params) do
    posts =
      App.Post
      |> build_query(params)
      |> Repo.all()

    json(conn, posts)
  end

  def build_query(query, "inserted_at", date, _conn) do
    query
    |> Ecto.Query.where([p], p.inserted_at >= ^date)
  end
end
```

### Handing fields that don't exist on the model

The keys you query against don't need to exist on the model. Revisting
the date example, let's say we want to find all posts inserted for a
given month and year:

```elixir
def build_query(query, attr, value, _conn) when attr == "month" or attr == "year" do
  query
  |> Ecto.Query.where([e], fragment("date_part(?, ?) = ?", ^attr, e.inserted_at, type(^value, :integer)))
end
```

### Usage Outside of Phoenix Controllers

To use inside a module other than a Phoenix Controller, you'll need to import `Ecto.from/1` otherwise you may see an error like `cannot use ^value outside of match clauses`.

Note: we use `warn: false` to suppress an incorrect warning generated by Elixir thinking `from` is unused.

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.PlainModule do
  import Ecto.Query, only: [from: 1], warn: false
  use Inquisitor
end
```
